    <h1>Welcome to MusicNet!</h1>

    <h2>Social Network Name</h2>
    <p>
      Our social network is called "MusicNet," built using React.js for the
      frontend and a Python server for the backend. We use MySQL to manage and
      store the data.
    </p>

    <h2>Additional Pages</h2>
    <p>We have added two additional pages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Piano:</strong> A virtual piano where users can play their
        favorite tunes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Survey:</strong> A page where users can vote for the best band
        in the world.
      </li>
    </ul>
